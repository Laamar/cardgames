First I wanted to add the game spades into my project but I couldn't get the game to pop up on a new window.
So I just decided to create a memory game as well as a Declare War card game. But I had the same problem as the spades game where I
couldn't get the games to show up of the new window.
Another problem I had with Spades was that I had 4 different players but the user could see the other players hands.
